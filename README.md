# Object Measurement and Detection System

This project implements an image-based object measurement and detection system using computer vision techniques. The system captures an image of the object, processes it to identify boundaries or features, and calculates physical measurements like height and width. It can be used in real-time quality control, manufacturing inspection, or research applications.

## Project Preview

Here are sample images used in the project:
- Input object with known dimensions
- Processed image with contour detection
- Final output with dimensions labeled

## Features

- Automatic object detection  
- Dimension calculation (height, width)  
- Real-time processing using OpenCV  
- Visual display of results with bounding boxes and labels  

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  # streamlit-measurement-app
